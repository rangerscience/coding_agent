I need to gather information to help complete a plan step.

Analyze this plan step and determine:
1. What specific information is needed to complete this step?
2. What files, code, or documentation should be examined?
3. What context from the project would be helpful?
4. Are there any dependencies or prerequisites that should be checked?

Your last response must be the full set of gathered information needed to complete the task.
