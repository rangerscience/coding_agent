File tools module with 4 tools:
1. ListFiles - Lists files in a directory
2. ReadFile - Reads file contents
3. WriteFile - Writes content to a file
4. EditFile - Replaces text in a file

All tools have restrictions for .env and .mise.toml files.
Current descriptions are verbose and need simplification.
